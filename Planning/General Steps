Backend Development with Java Spring Boot:

    Spring Boot Setup:
        Set up your Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr, which provides a simple way to bootstrap your application with the necessary dependencies.
   
    RESTful API Design:
        Design a RESTful API to handle requests from the frontend. This will include endpoints for managing user schedules, assignments, events, and integrating with the Google Calendar API.
   
    Google Calendar API Integration:
        Utilize the Google Calendar API to sync user events. This will involve OAuth2 authentication to allow users to securely connect their Google accounts.
        Implement service classes in Spring Boot to interact with the Google Calendar API.
    
    Database Integration:
        Choose a database like PostgreSQL or MySQL for storing user data, schedules, and notes. Spring Boot makes it easy to integrate with these databases using Spring Data JPA.
    
    Security:
        Implement security using Spring Security, ensuring user authentication and secure API access.
    
    Testing:
        Write unit and integration tests using frameworks like JUnit and Mockito to ensure your backend logic is robust and reliable.


Frontend Development:
    Choosing a Frontend Framework:
        Select a JavaScript framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js for building the user interface. React, for instance, is widely used and has a large community and support.

    Integration with Backend:
        Ensure seamless communication between the frontend and backend using AJAX calls (fetch or Axios libraries can be used for this purpose).

    User Interface Design:
        Design a responsive and intuitive user interface. Pay special attention to the user experience, making the application easy to navigate and use.

    Frontend Routing:
        Implement client-side routing using libraries like React Router (for React) to handle different views like the dashboard, schedule planner, and settings.
